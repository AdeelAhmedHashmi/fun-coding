# Vanilla JavaScript Beginner Projects

**Core HTML, CSS & JavaScript Projects for Beginners**

A beginner-friendly collection of **Vanilla JavaScript projects** built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**—no frameworks, no libraries, no shortcuts.

This repository documents my **learning-era projects**, created when I was starting out in web development. The purpose is to help **new coders understand core frontend fundamentals** before moving to modern frameworks.

## About This Repository

This repository contains small to medium-sized frontend projects built with:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**

All projects are intentionally kept simple to focus on:

- JavaScript logic
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Basic UI behavior

No React. No Vue. No build tools.
Just the **raw web stack**—the way it all began.

---

## Important Disclaimer

> These projects were created during my **beginner learning phase**.

That means:

- Code may not be fully optimized
- Patterns may be basic
- Best practices may evolve over time

This is intentional.
The goal is **learning and clarity**, not perfection.

## Who This Repo Is For

This repository is ideal for:

- Beginners learning **JavaScript from scratch**
- Students practicing **HTML, CSS, and JS projects**
- Self-taught developers building fundamentals
- Anyone who wants to understand **JavaScript without frameworks**

If you want to master frameworks later, this is where you start.

## Project Structure

Most projects follow a simple structure:

```text
project-name/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── script.js
```

No setup required.
Just open `index.html` in a browser and explore.
